It is 5 November 2025 today. I got up at 7.50am and washed as quickly as possible. The breakfast at the third canteen on the second floor is very good, cheap and varied. I had a hamburger and took a drink with me. After that, I studied for a long time. Firstly, I studied the taxonomy of fungi, which taught me about the rules for naming new species of fungi. During my break, my technical teacher told me that we would be building a programme, which attracted my attention to programming in the post-course period.

Today is 6 November 2025. Next, I will talk about three sections: What I studied, how I feel, and how I should face the next day. Firstly, I studied academic English writing, proteomics, Python and epigenomics. Of all the things I studied, the story about one nature article published by an doctor for working long time. Today, I don't feel good and I feel like everything is coming at me. Tomorrow, I will tackle each task one by one.
