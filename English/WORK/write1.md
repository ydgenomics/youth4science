# Presentation: Unit1 reading text A

Good evening, everyone.

In the next few minutes I’d like to show you the background of Reading Text A: “Descartes Was Wrong: ‘A Person Is a Person Through Other Persons’.”  
The title itself raises two questions: Who is Descartes, and why is he “wrong” here? My talk will answer both.

Who is Descartes?  
1. Descartes was a 17th-century French scientist, philosopher, and mathematician.  
2. He is the father of modern philosophy because he insisted that knowledge must begin with certainty, not tradition.  
3. “I think, therefore I am.” is His best-known sentence

After understanding who Descartes is, we cannot help but wonder how such a great person is considered to have made mistakes.

Why is Descartes wrong here?  
Look again at his famous line: it positions the individual mind as the ultimate source of identity and knowledge. The thinking “I” is portrayed as a lone, self-sufficient origin of truth—an exaggeration of the mind’s solitary power.
The author distills his insight: “A person is a person through other persons.” This means identity and understanding are not self-generated but arise through interactions and shared experiences with others.
The title itself reflects the author’s stance, and the comparison-and-contrast method sharpens the contrast between isolated individualism and relational identity.
