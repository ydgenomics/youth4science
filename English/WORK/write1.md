# Presentation: Unit1 reading text A

Good evening, everyone.

In the next few minutes I’d like to give you the background you need to understand Reading Text A: “Descartes Was Wrong: ‘A Person Is a Person Through Other Persons’.”  
The title itself raises two questions: Who is Descartes, and why is he “wrong”? My talk will answer both.

Who is Descartes?  
I’ve summarized some facts from Wikipedia and paragraph three of the text.  
1. Descartes was a 17th-century French scientist, philosopher, and mathematician.  
2. He is the father of modern philosophy because he broke with medieval scholasticism and insisted that knowledge must begin with certainty, not tradition.  
3. His best-known sentence, from the *Discourse on the Method*, is “I think, therefore I am.”

From these points we can see that Descartes is a famous figure. Now let’s focus on why the article claims he is “wrong.”

Why is Descartes wrong here?  
Look again at his famous line: it makes the **individual mind** the ultimate source of identity and knowledge.  
Notice the grammar: the thinking “I” is singular and self-contained. That solitary “I” will matter in a moment.
We could feel it emphasizes self.

Contemporary psychology tells us three points:  
- Eye-contact shapes me: Self-awareness emerges through eye-contact, language, and play with caregivers.  
- Attachment wires us: Neural circuits for emotion are co-constructed by caregivers via attachment.  
- Culture codes we-ness: Cultures that prize interdependence shape different “selves” from cultures that prize independence.
We could feel it emphasizes relational.


The text’s central claim—“A person is a person through other persons”—stands in direct contrast to Descartes’ view. The author uses this comparison-and-contrast method to make that point clear.
